title: What is a system bug?

###### I am always posting provoking post on my Linkedin, and I have decided to replicate those here. [Let's socialize!](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexsandro-souza-dev)

You should stop putting all the not perfect behaviour of your system in the bug basket.

Is essential to understand that not every defect in the system should be classified as a bug; it could be called a feature gap, edge case issue or inconsistency.

Imagine that all buttons submit in an e-commerce are blue, would you call a yellow submit button as a bug?

What is a bug then?
Some people would say that bug is anything that threatens the quality.

When I am managing software projects, I prefer to define bug as the failures or crashes of the user-facing system.

Better defect labelling will help the team prioritise what makes the most impact on the business.
