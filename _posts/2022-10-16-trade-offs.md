Why "right or wrong" and other binary decision making doesn’t exist when developing software?

As a decision-maker, I wish I could just take binary decisions. Life would be way easier If I just needed to choose between the good or bad, the cheap or expensive, the simple or complex options, however, in reality, it is never like that. Every "yes" to one thing, is a "no" to everything else.

Should we use Java or Golang, MySQL or Oracle, microservices or monolithic, AWS or GCP?

There is no right or wrong. The choice that seems like the best option right now may not be the right choice in 6 months. It may not even be the right choice right now. But the only way to know is to make a choice. By taking action, you move in a direction.

Then you can evaluate that decision by measuring your progress toward your goal.

If you realize you’re off track, make adjustments. Please! don't be afraid to be wrong and more importantly, don't be afraid to admit mistakes

Each decision we make, each action we take, provides us with an incredibly undervalued tool: Experience!

Mistakes can cost money and are the manager's role to make sure people are making an educated decision and experiences has been considered.
