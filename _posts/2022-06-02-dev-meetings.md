title: Developers don't like meetings -  That's not true

###### I am always posting provoking post on my Linkedin, and I have decided to replicate those here. [Let's socialize!](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexsandro-souza-dev)


Some people say that developers don't like meetings, well, that's not really true. I appreciate being in the decision-maker meetings.

When we say we don't like meetings what we really mean is:

- "We dislike inefficiency."
- "we dislike poorly planned meetings."
- "We dislike poorly executed meetings."
- "We dislike not keeping our promises."
- "We dislike missing our team iteration deadline."
- "We dislike not getting enough time to do our job."

Having work done for developers and managers follows a different process:

- Managers get stuff done through meetings.
- Developers and other creators need 3-4 hour blocks of time to get work done.
- For a Dev, a single meeting at the wrong time can disrupt their entire day of work.

For everyone who has your work done through meetings,
beware that the meeting might be for you and you will get work done, so you're probably feeling great. Your team probably did not get work done and might not be feeling as great.

Developers are nice creatures and also feel great if they contributed to your work and for the company success. Just make sure they are required for those meetings.


### Free Advanced Java Course
I am the author of the [Advanced Java for adults course](https://www.udemy.com/course/advanced-java-for-adults/?referralCode=8014CCF0A5A931ADED5F). This course contains advanced and not conventional lessons. In this course, you will learn to think differently from those who have a limited view of software development. I will provoke you to reflect on decisions that you take in your day to day job, which might not be the best ones. This course is for middle to senior developers and we will not teach Java language features but how to lead complex Java projects.

This course's lectures are based on a Trading system, an opensource project hosted on my [Github](https://github.com/apssouza22/trading-system).
