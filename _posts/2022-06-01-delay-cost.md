title: The Cost of Delays

###### I am always posting provoking post on my Linkedin, and I have decided to replicate those here. [Let's socialize!](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexsandro-souza-dev)

The only way not to wind up late, on a long enough timeline, is never actually to have deadlines.

The agile movement has encouraged us to minimise, if not eliminate, deadlines. That is achieved by incremental value delivery and shipping often to production.

That approach does a great job of eliminating artificial deadlines, but delays will still exist, and we need to be aware of the Cost of Delay to help define product priorities.

"We need Cost of Delay to evaluate the cost of queues, the value of excess capacity, the benefit of smaller batch sizes and the value of variability reduction. Cost of Delay is the golden key that unlocks many doors. It has an astonishing power to totally transform the mindset of a development organisation."  - Reinertsen, Donald.

The cost of delay can vary depending on the situation, and its cost is not always money.

Be mindful of your product and your market. Always be surrounded by intelligent people with the correct information to help you make the best decisions.
