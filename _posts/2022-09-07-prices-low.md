title: The small fraction of your team will do most of the work

###### I am always posting provoking post on my Linkedin, and I have decided to replicate those here. [Let's socialize!](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexsandro-souza-dev)

When a company grows, competence grows linearly, and incompetence grows exponentially. That is what Price's Law suggests.

Price's Law (also known as Price's Square Root Law) states that 50% of all work will be done by the square root of the total number of people who take part in the work.

Price's Law is merely an idea/theory and not a scientific fact. It is like Pareto's Principle and is more of a rule of thumb. The underlying concept is that a small fraction of your team will do most of your work.

With this concept in mind, we can do proactive things to identify, recognize and try to increase this small minority.
