Technology and modern working policies empower staff with more choices of how, when and where they work. Measuring output rather than presenteeism is a shift in how we work.

Team Principles is a guide to help with this new paradigm shift. Principles cover generalities, allow adaptation to unforeseen circumstances, don't put people in a box, and enable team members to use their best judgment and be innovative.

Team Principles will help everyone in the team thinking in a way that it maximises the effectiveness of delivering software
