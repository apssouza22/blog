Algorithms already write code, but human developers donâ€™t need to fear being immediately replaced

Based on research, programmers spend 35% of their time on understanding code, 5% on writing code, 10% on other coding-related activities, and 50% on other non-coding activities

Considering that only 5% of the time a developer is writing code, I don't expect AI tools to redefine the profession of a programmer any time soon.

Many people are still not sure if AI pair programming is a blessing or a curse, and that is fine, but if you care about productivity, I think you should be experimenting with one of the AI pair programming tools.
