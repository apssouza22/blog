What important truth do very few people agree with you on?

That is the favourite question of Peter Thiel when interviewing a candidate. He also says, "Brilliant thinking is rare, but courage is in even shorter supply than genius."

Thinking for yourself is often very challenging, and it is easier to maintain the status quo.

A good answer is one that sparks a unique view of the world and shows the candidate doesn't think like their peers.

Original thoughts are difficult to have because you are a product of your environment. If surrounded by people who hold a specific view, you will likely come to hold that view over time.

On my mission to deliver value to customers as faster and cheaper as possible, I am constantly questioning the mainstream thoughts; here some examples:
- Microservices is not the best way to draw boundaries
- Documentation is not a critical success factor in software development
- The "unit" on Unit testing is not methods and classes
- Test coverage metrics are evil
- ORM most of the times is not a good idea
- Over abstraction is evil
- Avoid coding interviews when hiring
- Scrum is not the best Agile framework
- REST-based APIs are not great
- Software estimation is waste
- Consensus decisions are not smart and an illusion of safety
